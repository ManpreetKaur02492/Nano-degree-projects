# Nano-degree-projects
I have uploaded all my nano-degree projects. I used pyhton and it's libraries to complete these projects.

#### What do I need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas

* NumPy

* Matplotlib

I recommend installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.

Projects to learn the data analysis process using python and it's libraries.

Project 1: Explore Weather Trends

Project 2: Investigate a Dataset (a Tmdb movies dataset)

Project 3: Analyze A/B Test Results

Project 4: Gather, Clean and Analyze Twitter Data (WeRateDogs)

Project 5: Communicate Data Findings
