### Summary

In Explore Weather Trends project, I analyzed local and global temperature data. I compared the temperature trends in "Canada" and city "Victoria city" to overall global temperature trends.I live in Canada and this city is the nearest to my place.

I extracted the data from Udacity's workspace for world and Victora city, Canada.I used Basics of sql to interact with data.

In data exploration part, I imported both datasets and checked the basic inforamtion of datasets such as no. of rows and columns, statistical information, and null values etc.

In plot and visualization part, I used line chart to compare the temperature trends of Victoria city with Golobal temperature.
I also calculated the moving averages. I plotted moving averages against yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines so, I can see the trends in temperature more clearly.

I attached the all needed files such as project pdf,python notebook, and csv files.
