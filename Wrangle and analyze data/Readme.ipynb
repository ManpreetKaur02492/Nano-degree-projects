    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, we will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. I have documented my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook,pdf file showing analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).\n",

    "### Project Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation behind the Wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data is to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for \"Wow!\"-worthy analyses and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Files\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enhanced Twitter Archive\n",
    "\n",
    "The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything.One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog \"stage\" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive \"enhanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data via the Twitter API\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the basic-ness of Twitter archives: retweet count and favorite count are two of the notable column omissions. Fortunately, this additional data can be gathered by anyone from Twitter's API. Well, \"anyone\" who has access to data for the 3000 most recent tweets, at least.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Image Predictions File\n",
    "\n",
    "The data file is full of image predictions (the top three only) alongside each tweet ID, image URL, and the image number that corresponded to the most confident prediction (numbered 1 to 4 since tweets can have up to four images).\n",
